repo for challenge 18


For this Challenge we had the task of designing a streamlit interface to use for a ledger application that uses cryptography to record transactions publically. The first steps were simple, create a dataclass & replace the old dataclasses with the new, Record. Then we were prompted to add interface optionalit yfor users to input sender, receiver, & amount - Note, I also added some features I think are necessary for these inputs; a character count of 100 to avoid spam & having autocomplete turned off in perpetuity. I then launched the app via terminal to a locally hosted page & tested the app by making some transactions. <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-18 at 4 28 59 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98225311/185489598-f7e1035e-bc57-4381-83e8-aaaffc932220.png">
You can see here that I send several transactions of differing values, senders, & receivers & the ledger works as anticipated.
